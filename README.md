# Full Stack Application - Yudio!
### By [Patrick](https://github.com/p-g-lai)


## Overview

This was a collaborative project assigned during General Assembly's Software Engineering Immersive course. The objective was to develop a full-stack application using PostgreSQL, Python, Flask, and React over six days. Although we were experienced with React and JavaScript, this project provided us with an opportunity to learn and practice using SQL databases, Python, and Flask.

As a team, we decided to create an educational streaming platform. The app allows users to upload videos, post comments, follow other users, and explore content based on their interests.

### About

- Build a full-stack application
- Create and manage a PostgreSQL database
- Implement database interactions with Python and Flask
- Design a RESTful API to serve data
- Develop a React-based frontend
- Ensure full CRUD functionality
- Design a responsive and visually appealing UI
- Deploy the application online

## Development Experience

To ensure effective teamwork and coherent development, we planned meticulously and divided tasks systematically. We paid particular attention to designing the database relationships. Here are the steps we followed:

1. Define user stories
2. Design the database schema and relationships
3. Develop core backend features as a team for a clear backend structure
4. Integrate external APIs into the backend
5. Connect backend endpoints to the React frontend
6. Establish a style guide, including wireframes, color palette, and logo
